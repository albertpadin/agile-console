agile-console
=============

# Dependency

agile is a python script file. So you would need Python.


# Installing

Download agile to any folder that you want. The Home folder is usually a good idea.


# Change the CHMOD permissions to give the file execution permissions.

cd into the same directory as the agile script and run the following:

```
chmod +x agile
```


# Adding the script to path

Add this into your .bashrc, .zshrc, or your shell configuration file

```
export PATH=/path/to/directory/applify-dev-console:$PATH
```


# Try it out!

Run the following:

```
agile tasks
```
